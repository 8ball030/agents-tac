### v1

The first iteration of our agents have an events based architecture.

### Display UML transition diagram

In order to visualize the UML transition diagram generated by the simulation (if the option `--uml True` has been used), 
you can do the following:

- build the `docker-tac-develop` image:

      ./docker-tac-develop/scripts/docker-build-img.sh
      
- run the image:

      ./docker-tac-develop/scripts/docker-run.sh -- /bin/bash
      
- use the following command:

      python3 -m plantuml `${data_output_dir}/${experiment_id}/diagram.uml`
      
  the output will be printed in the file `diagram.png`.
