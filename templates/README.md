Templates for agent development

## Available templates

- basic.py this lets you run a preconfigured baseline agent without further development
- advanced.py this lets you configure the strategy of the baseline agent without the need to implement the whole agent.
- expert.py this lets you start from scratch, only borrowing our agent architecture which separates the agent loop from the event loop.
